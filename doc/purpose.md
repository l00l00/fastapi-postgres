This repository, **l00l00/fastapi-postgres**, is a template and learning resource for building fullstack applications with a Python FastAPI backend and a PostgreSQL database. It is designed to provide a solid starting point for developers looking to create asynchronous web applications following best practices in modern backend development. Here’s an overview tailored as a summary and a learning resource:

---

## What is this repo about?

- **Purpose:**  
  It serves as a starter template for developing asynchronous FastAPI applications with PostgreSQL, featuring user authentication, database migrations, and Dockerized deployment. It lowers the barrier for developers seeking an opinionated, production-ready backend foundation.

- **Audience:**  
  - Backend developers (beginners to intermediate)
  - Fullstack developers wanting a Python/Postgres stack
  - Those learning about API design, async Python, or containerized deployments

---

## Key Features

- **FastAPI Backend:**  
  Uses FastAPI for building APIs, with an example structure for users and posts.
- **Asynchronous Programming:**  
  The database layer and API endpoints use asynchronous patterns for better performance.
- **PostgreSQL Integration:**  
  PostgreSQL is integrated as the main database, with connection management via SQLAlchemy’s async engine.
- **Docker Compose:**  
  The entire stack (API, DB, pgAdmin) is orchestrated using Docker Compose for easy local setup.
- **Database Migrations:**  
  Alembic is configured for managing schema migrations.
- **Authentication:**  
  JWT-based authentication is provided out-of-the-box.
- **PGAdmin4:**  
  Included for graphical database administration.
- **Test Setup:**  
  Provides basic test configuration with FastAPI’s TestClient and async database sessions.

## Design Patterns & Best Practices

- **Separation of Concerns:**  
  - `models/` for database models  
  - `schemas/` for Pydantic data validation  
  - `routes/` for API endpoints  
  - `database/dao/` for Data Access Objects (DAO) handling DB interaction  
  - `auth/` for authentication logic  
  - `config/` for configuration management
- **Async/Await:**  
  All DB operations are async, following modern FastAPI best practices.
- **Dependency Injection:**  
  Uses FastAPI’s `Depends` for injecting DB sessions and authenticated users.
- **Environment-based Configs:**  
  Sensitive and environment-dependent config (e.g., DB credentials, JWT secrets) are loaded from environment variables.
- **Dockerization:**  
  The use of Docker ensures reproducible environments and easy onboarding.
- **Modular Routers:**  
  Features are organized into modular routers, facilitating scalability and readability.
- **Testing:**  
  Setup for overriding dependencies and running isolated tests.

## How to Use as a Learning Resource or Starting Point

- **Learning Aspects:**  
  - Understand how to structure a FastAPI project for real-world use
  - Learn to implement async CRUD operations
  - See practical JWT authentication in action
  - Study Docker Compose setups for fullstack development
  - Learn DB migration workflows with Alembic
- **As a Starting Point:**  
  - Fork and customize for your own API/backend needs
  - Extend with your own models, endpoints, and services
  - Use as a reference for integrating async SQLAlchemy, FastAPI, and Docker

## Example Usage

To run the stack locally:

1. Build and start with Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
2. Run your first migration:
   ```
   docker compose exec app alembic revision --autogenerate -m "first migration"
   docker compose exec app alembic upgrade head
   ```
3. Access API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
4. Use pgAdmin at `http://localhost:5050` (login: admin@gmail.com / admin)

---

**In summary:**  
This repo is a practical, modern template for anyone wanting to build, learn from, or base their own fullstack applications on FastAPI and PostgreSQL, with best practices in project structure, async programming, authentication, migrations, and containerized deployment.
